# Value-stream-mapping-system

Designed and developed an application to analyze the value which each tool within a software production pipeline brings to enable product teams to speed up their work. Used REST APIs to gather data from tools like Jira, GitHub, Jenkins and Service Now and stored it in a MongoDB database. The backend scripts written in Python was used to fetch, aggregate and analyze the required data to Ô¨Ånd relations and inferences from it. Used Flask and React to render the application to the browser.
